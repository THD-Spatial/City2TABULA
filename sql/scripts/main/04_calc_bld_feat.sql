-- Aggregates per-surface attributes into a single row per building and inserts into
-- _building_feature. Skips buildings that already have a row in the target table.
--
-- Height semantics (both derived from child surface heights):
--   min_height — maximum vertical span of any WallSurface face (eave height).
--                Named "min" because it excludes the roof ridge contribution.
--   max_height — eave height + maximum vertical span of any RoofSurface face (ridge height).
--
-- Complexity codes (0 = simple, 1 = regular, 2 = complex):
--   footprint_complexity — based on vertex count of the merged GroundSurface boundary.
--   roof_complexity      — based on number of distinct RoofSurface polygons.
--
-- surface_count_floor is initialised to 0 here; area_total_floor is later overwritten
-- in script 06 as footprint_area × number_of_storeys (total heated floor area estimate).
