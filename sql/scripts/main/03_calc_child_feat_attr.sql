-- Calculates surface area, tilt, azimuth, and height for each surface polygon.

-- Pipeline stages:
--   1. new_buildings -> skip already-processed buildings
--   2. building_interior_pts -> one interior point per building (from GroundSurface)
--   3. raw_surfaces -> one row per polygon face
--   4. surface_points -> explode polygon to 3D vertices (ST_DumpPoints)
--   5. surface_edges -> pair each vertex with its LEAD successor
--   6. surface_normals -> Newell's method: accumulate edge-pair cross-products
--   7. oriented_normals -> dot-product flip to enforce outward-facing normal
--   8. normalized_normals -> per-class flip rules + unit normalisation
--   9. convergence_corrected -> placeholder for UTM meridian convergence (see Discussion)
--   10. INSERT -> _child_feature_surface

-- Newell's method (surface_normals):
--   nx = SUM (y_i − y_{i+1}) * (z_i + z_{i+1})
--   ny = SUM (z_i − z_{i+1}) * (x_i + x_{i+1})
--   nz = SUM (x_i − x_{i+1}) * (y_i + y_{i+1})
--   Handles non-planar polygons correctly (best-fit normal); planar polygons give
--   the same result as any 3-point cross-product. O(n) per surface.
