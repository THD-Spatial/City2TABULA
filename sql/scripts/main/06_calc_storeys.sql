-- Refines number_of_storeys as min_height / room_height (both in metres).
-- Also overwrites area_total_floor with footprint_area × number_of_storeys, replacing
-- the raw GroundSurface area sum from script 04 with a total heated floor area estimate.
-- Note: area_total_floor in the SET clause uses the OLD number_of_storeys value (pre-update)
-- because PostgreSQL evaluates all SET expressions from the row state before the UPDATE.
