    This project is under active development and may change frequently.

## Overview

City2TABULA is a Go-based CLI tool for processing raw 3D city model data and generating enriched building feature data in PostgreSQL/PostGIS. It supports the preparation of building datasets for downstream energy-modelling, research, and classification workflows.

The tool is designed for scalable processing of LoD2 and LoD3 building data stored through CityDB-based database structures. It automates key steps such as data setup, import, and feature extraction within a single pipeline.
